Chernobyl happened one day,
but was not until the next day 
that the chatastrophe 
hit the world as a tsunami.
Mexico earthquake happened one day,
but was not until he next day
that the world discovered
a city under the ruble.
Dates are just an arbitrary
fixation of the human
trying to ordering the chaos.
But I like chaos, hence this message.

I am on the fence, crossing the line to the chaos and back to the safe space. But who am I, and what rigth do I have to order the chaos? Who am I but an undercover destroyer of worlds?

Everything is for nothing, I must remember, for things that live in the imaginary space of pi. Even if not, pi is infinity, a far away number discovered time ago, expanding for years without control.
