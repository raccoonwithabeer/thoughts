Chernobyl happened one day,
but was not until the next day 
that the chatastrophe 
hit the world as a tsunami.
Mexico earthquake happened one day,
but was not until he nexy day
that the world discovered
a city under the ruble.
Dates are just an arbitrary
fixation of the human
trying to ordering the chaos.
But I like chaos, hence this message.
